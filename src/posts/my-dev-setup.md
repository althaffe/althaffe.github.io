# My development setup

OS: Elementary Loki

- Primary Editor: Spacemacs
  
  I've used a number of editors over the years. Starting from Notepad++, then moving on to Sublime, Brackets, Atom and finally settled on VS Code as my go-to editor for quite a while. VS Code with Vim mode was quite a thing, but switching back and forth between both Vim and VS Code bindings, my workflow was somewhat messy. I never were able to get a grip of Vim completely. Switching to Vim was a no-no for modern web development (at least I lacked the skills to configure Vim).
  
  Then, while researching for a good personal knowledge management setup, I started seeing Org Mode everywhere. I went through a few YouTube videos and saw how powerful and efficient it was. And that led me to installing Spacemacs (I hated Emacs keybindings, hold ctrl key for everything - seriously?), which came with a lot of stuff I needed pre-configured.
  
  And thus after a long journey through the editor land, I finally reached my Space. I do go back to VS Code occassionally though.
