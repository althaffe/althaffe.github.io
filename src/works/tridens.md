I always had an interest in the field of cyber security. So when I got a chance
to work on a very niche cyber security platform, it felt like the right project
for me, not to mention the excitement.

As a cherry on top, working closely with the incredibly talented CTO of the company Sami was a great
learning experience for the then-still-amateur me. 

With the financial risks associated to cyber attacks extending to millions of
dollars these days, Threatspan's offering has great potential in the shipping and
maritime industry. In their words,

> â€œOur solution combines intrusion detection, resilience monitoring, cyber risk
> scoring and more in a streamlined fleet management console."

Since this is a cyber security platform, we had a lot of data to be received
from the environments, and one interesting challenge was figuring out the
representation and visualization of this in the most helpful manner.
