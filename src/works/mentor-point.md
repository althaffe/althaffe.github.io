Most online courses follow a fixed curriculum from start to end. MentorPoint was
designed in a way that, after a mandatory initial learning path, the rest of the
curriculum was assigned based on periodic assessments.

Since the design decisions were mostly left to me, I chose my favourite css
framework Bulma. I think it's evident from the design if you are familiar with
the framework.

The admin panel was a more involved piece of work than the user facing side.
Admin is able to add lessons through a wysiwyg editor as well as add and edit
quizzes.
