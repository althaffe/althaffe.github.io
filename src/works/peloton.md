There is a dire need of innovation in the education sector. Anything than can
help students grow, especially those that teaches them 'How to learn' is a welcome
addition. I was excited to work with Diego and Nina of Stanford Graduate School
of Education on their masters project, which aimed at helping students to be
aware of their strengths and weaknesses and placing them in a growth mindset.

More details about the inception of the idea and details about the project can
be found in [this article](https://medium.com/@diegosalva.ds/portfolio-project-case-study-know-yourself-4834b49c7d77)

Peloton is integrated with Google Classroom API so that teachers can login with
their Classroom integrated email and can import their classes and students from their existing classrooms. 

Teachers and students have separate logins. Teachers are able to add new
projects and assign students to them, where as students can work on these
launched projects.
